  description: "Starting a new software project is exciting! It’s your chance to build something clean, functional, and easy to manage. But without a strong foundation, even small projects can quickly spiral into a confusing mess of bugs, untracked changes, and hard-to-follow code. This is especially true in research environments, where programming often takes a backseat to scientific discovery, and software evolves unpredictably as it adapts to new experiments and shared use.  So how do you set yourself up for success from the beginning?"

  description: "Donated data is user behavioral data, usually recorded by a third party, that a potential subject on a research project already has access to. Anyone who wears a sport tracker, owns a phone, or uses a computer, constantly collects data about their behavior. A lot of this data is accessible to the user and can be donated to different research projects. I will present recent additions to the Niimpy Python library for processing data from takeout.google.com, Googles service for exporting user data, as well as surrounding infrastructure accepting donated data."

  description: "Ethics.  AI.  These days, people propose all sorts of solutions to the challenges of modern technology.  But some of these ideas go against long standing principles of the free software/open source movements. Is that good?  Do these principles still have a place now, or do we need a re-evaluation of the basic principles?  In order to answer this, we need to understand what these principles are, why they all are, and the history of them.  This talk will attempt to do this."

  title: "Unreviewed and Unrunnable? On the role of peer review in publishing reproducible research software"
  description: "Have you ever read an interesting research article and got excited to find accompanying code in a Git repository? And have you felt disillusioned after spending considerable time and effort on the attempt to fix that code, left wondering if it had ever been tested? Have you been uncertain what to do due to a lack of instructions, or found out that necessary files were missing? Or have you ended up caught in the dependency hell? We noticed that this was a common theme among researchers and research software engineers across the globe and across disciplines. But how grave is the reproducibility crisis when it comes to research software? And do the typical peer review models of associated research articles enable some of the issues we commonly observe? This talk will share our insights from a recent study targeted at answering those questions. We collected around 480 Git repositories from thematically linked literature in various fields like computational biology, chemistry, immunology, and drug design published in over 70 different journals within the past five years. We first analyzed author and reviewer guidelines and noted an encouraging increase in publishers' efforts to promote the public release of source code in the interest of reproducibility. We conducted a systematic evaluation of over 200 Python-based Git repositories, reviewing instructions on installation and usage, and assessing our ability to deploy and run the repository in our own environment when following the provided instructions. Around every 5th repository had complete installation instructions, and about 40% came with at least partial instructions, enabling us to successfully install more than half of the repositories. Running the repositories was fully reproducible for about 1/5th of the cases, and another 20% were partially runnable without deviations from the instructions or additional required steps. Finally, we were also able to rescue around 20% with minor fixes. However, these numbers also highlight the significant amount of repositories with more severe reproducibility shortcomings and incomplete or missing instructions. We believe that peer review could improve this situation and will discuss the possible reasons for limited or non-systematic review of code contributions. We will also demonstrate the dramatic impact a potential assessment of only the Git repository landing page could have - even if a reviewer does not have programming experience. Finally, we propose strategies how authors, reviewers, publishers and the community alike can support a further increase in robustly reproducible, runnable research software contributions."

  title: "A decade of bug fixing - Building (and maintaining) an open-source tool for research and science communication"
  description: "OpenSpace is an interactive open-source visualization software designed to visualize the entire known universe. During the last decade, the project has grown from a PhD thesis project into a NASA co-funded ecosystem for research and science communication, used in people’s homes, planetariums, museums, and as a platform for research in both visualization and astronomy. Using the same system for all these areas enables a short circuiting of the knowledge dissemination pipeline by lowering the barrier for domain experts to present their findings to the public. This talk describes the OpenSpace project and the efforts that go into the software’s development and the interaction with researchers, planetariums, users and an active open-source community. It will present some of the software features, explain some of the design considerations, and elaborate on lessons learned when scaling up research software for use in the general public and dealing with the onslaught of bugs that come with it. While much development originates from researchers and engineers at Linköping University, the project is also a collaboration with The American Museum of Natural History, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, University of Utah, and New York University."

  title: "Harnessing power and synergy – Using game engines to produce visualization and simulation"
  description: "Using visualization and simulation is a powerful method to test and possibly answer research questions. For the visualization, a well-defined visual method can help a researcher gain insight to truths that are otherwise often obscured when analysing large result datasets through other methods. For the simulation, you can set up scenarios to produce empiric observations that are meant to help answer a research question, rather than trying to prove them with with pure theory, which might be a more cumbersome task and not without its own set of issues and potential pitfalls. Setting up the environments for either method is not a small task, however. One often needs to implement methods for various systems needed, like graphics, interaction, physics, particles, scripting, etc. While there are software solutions available, they often require the user to scale a steep learning curve before being able to operate them efficiently. So unless the user has been diligent in learning specialised software beforehand, using these tools is quite unlikely in a realistic scenario. This lightning talk presents a simple case where a game engine has facilitated the development of a research project, because the game engine was a known tool to the developer beforehand."

  title: "Experiences from 'High-performance R' course "
  description: "A researcher using R to analyse their data and conduct statistical analyses may run into a situation where the computational limits of their laptop have been reached or the analyses simply take too long. What to do then? Depending on the researcher's background, R is approached either as a programming language or as an off-the-shelf statistical analysis software via RStudio. We set out to develop an R course in CSC that aims at teaching how R can be used efficiently by looking at how R is designed as a programming language to facilitate analyses in an efficient way in terms of hardware resources and then extending to R usage in an HPC environment. The course is aimed for any researcher using R as their main programming language and wanting to expand their knowledge of R. The instructors' backgrounds include both computer science and a field-specific data analysis perspective in using R. In this talk we give an overview of the course content, discuss experiences from the first course instance in autumn 2024, and outline some future plans."

  description: "Cities of the future are challenged to cope with population growth and an increasing demand for services while reducing their envronmental footprints. A part of a solution is in designing better connected road networks and in transforming urban areas such that minimise commuting time. Hence, Trondheim is among the first to apply the principles of a 15-minute-city - most destinations needed on daily basis are to be found within 15 minutes of commuting time. Analysis of quantity and quality of urban services within reach, given the origin of the trip, various means of transport, existing or planned road networks and other variables, however, is a computationally challenging task that needs custom software. This talk presents an ongoing development of a web-instrument to meet such needs in research on urban planning, and elaborates on desig principles of applications based on graph theory, geospatial computing, complex data pipelines and GPU-acceleration."

  description: "Scientific software comes in all shapes and sizes; from small scripts to large systems.
               While techniques such as containerisation has simplified installation and dependency resolution, getting a program to run can still be a major hurdle for its intended end user.
               This tutorial will showcase how scientific software projects, in particular those with a need for 3D visualisation, can be shared as static web apps. This way, no installation is required by the user, as they simply visit a URL. Furthermore, no backend needs to be maintained, since the processing is performed and the data is stored locally (in the client application).
               Using modern frameworks such as Three.js (for webGL and webVR), Metro UI (for ribbon UI), Vega-Lite (for simple plotting), and Pyodide (for Python support).

  title: "<b>Keynote</b>: Clarity, Not Consensus: Rethinking Unity in Open Science"
  description: "Open science means different things to different people and fields—ranging from open access and data sharing to open-source tools, preregistration, participatory methods, and efforts to address inequities. This multiplicity is both a strength and a source of tension, especially around ideology and inclusion. These tensions echo the debates of the 1990s within the free/libre and open source software (FLOSS) community, where unresolved ideological divides led to lasting fragmentation between “open source” and “free/libre software”.
                Drawing on my background in psychology and a decade of promoting open research practices, I highlight how today’s open science movement faces conceptual confusion and disagreement—particularly around ideological values and terminology—that could lead to a split akin to what happened within FLOSS.
                I argue that we don’t need to agree on a single definition of open science. A more sustainable foundation is mutual clarity about terms and intentions—something increasingly relevant as open science practices begin to shape expectations across research fields, including for software engineers. Implicit ideas about what 'openness' means might surface in decisions about who qualifies as an author, how data is shared or protected, or how collaboration is structured. Clearer definitions can help ensure those assumptions are intentional, not accidental."
